# Banking-AI-Governance  

Banking AI Governance explores building and auditing AI/ML models in banking with a strong focus on **compliance, transparency, and ethical AI**. This repository bridges **AI/ML innovation with governance frameworks**, combining technical model development (fraud detection, credit scoring, payments monitoring) with **strategic oversight** for risk management, bias detection, audit automation, and regulatory alignment.  

The goal is to create high-performing models that are **auditable, explainable, and responsibly deployed**, enabling banks to adopt AI at scale without compromising on governance, ethics, or global financial regulations.
